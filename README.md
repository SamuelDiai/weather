Project for the course Deep Learning from Maria Vakalopoulou and Vincent Lepetit.

This work was made by **Paul Martin** (ENPC) and **Samuel Diai** (ENPC).

The project is about weather forecasting using Attention based encoder decoders.

It is based on the paper : "**A Dual-Stage Attention-Based Recurrent Neural Network for Time Series Prediction**" by 
Yao and Al.
